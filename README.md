# SpotifyRecap
A 3-day self-learning project where I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Spotify data. It explores top artists, song trends, mood patterns, and audio features like danceability, instrumentalness, and loudness. Built from scratch using free resources, DAX, and Power BI , driven by curiosity and a love for music.

<h1>Welcome to my passion project!</h1><br>
<h6>Over the course of 3 days, I set myself a challenge:
Learn Power BI from scratch
</h6>

<h3>What was the aim here ?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze something I love — Spotify</li>
  <li>Understand and apply DAX for calculated insights</li>
  <li>Build a professional-looking interactive dashboard</li>
  <li>Learn something new from scratch (via YouTube and other free resources)</li>
</ul><br><br>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
The dashboard offers deep insights into Spotify music data and allows for interactive exploration of:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Top Artists & Trending Songs</li>
  <li>Mood Patterns Over 9 Days</li>
  <li>Loudness, Energy, and Explicit Content – and their impact on popularity</li>
  <li>Danceability, Tempo, Instrumentalness – and their correlation with listener preferences</li>
</ul>


<h3>Key Insights</h3>
Some fascinating patterns emerged from the analysis:
<ul>
  <li>Instrumentalness in a tight range boosts popularity by 23%</li>
  <li>Danceability leads listener moods with over 55% share</li>
  <li>Surprisingly, 66% of popular tracks are non-explicit</li>
</ul>
